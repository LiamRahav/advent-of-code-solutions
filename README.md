This repo is full of all my solutions for the Advent of Code christmas programming challenge (http://adventofcode.com)

I wrote everything in Python 2.7.6

In order for everything to work right, use the included virtual environment (I added some fancy output for some of them)

`$ source venv/bin/activate`

I'll be adding in README's to each day's problem when I have the time

Enjoy!
